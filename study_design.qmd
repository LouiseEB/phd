*Calculating power and estimating sample size*

An important consideration when designing a study, is including a sufficient sample size in order to test the hypothesis. Failing to do this may lead to type 1 (false positive or rejecting a null hypothesis that is in fact true) or type 2 error (false negative or failing to reject a null hypothesis that is in fact false) (FIGURE?)
